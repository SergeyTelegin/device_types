  ### APC Smart-UPS XL Extended Run Battery Pack 48V, VRLA, rackmount, 2U
  
  The [APC SUM48RMXLBP2U] has two battery sleds. Each Sled attached to the chassis via an [Anderson Power] connector: [sbr-50].
  
  Connection to the UPS is done with a larger [Anderson Power] connector [sbr-120].
  Connection to additional battery units facilitated via  a pair of sbr-50 connectors chained together.  
  
  **Note:** I could not find a link for this specific connector. I believe it's simply two SBS50 plugs strapped together.

  #### Connections
