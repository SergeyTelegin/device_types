  ### APC Battery Expansion Chassis
  ###### Smart-UPS XL Extended Run Battery Pack
  ------
  
  ------
  
  The [APC SUM48RMXLBP2U] has two battery sleds. Each Sled attached to the chassis via an [Anderson Power] connector: [sbr-50].  
  
  Connection to the UPS is done with a larger [Anderson Power] connector [sbr-120].  
  Connection to additional battery units facilitated via what appears to be a pair of [sbr-50] connectors chained together.
